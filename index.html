    <blockquote>
      Welcome to Renner Recipe App. This website was created after the need to
      stop printing off so many recipes and then losing them or wasting paper.
      Plus, it is nice to have a central location in which all of the family can
      look at some of the recipes that we love to cook and enjoy. This is a
      current work in progress and a fun little side project that I am currently
      enjoying when I have the time. This project can be improved in many ways
      and optimized to run faster and easier for me to develop. Ideally, in the
      futurem, you will be able to upload a new recipe either using a url or by
      uploading a picture.
