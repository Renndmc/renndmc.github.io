      <h2>Directions:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment
          and spread the potato tots on the sheet. Bake until golden brown and
          crisp, about 25 minutes. Transer the baking sheet to a wire rack and
          let cool. Lower the oven to 400 degrees F.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Meanwhile, heat the sausage in a large nonstick skillet over medium
          heat and cook, stirring to break up the sausage, until browned and no
          longer pink, about 8 minutes. Transfer the sausage to paper towels
          with a slotted spoon to drain; discard any remaining fat. Let the
          sausage cool, then crumble into 1/2-inch pieces.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Heat the bacon in the skillet over medium heat and cook, flipping
          once, until browned, about 8 minutes. Using tongs, transfer the bacon
          to paper towels to drain; discard any remaining fat. Let the bacon
          cool, then crumble into 1/2-inch pieces.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Prepare a bowl of ice water and set aside. Cover 4 eggs by 1 inch with
          water in a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Cover the pan, remove
          from the heat and let the eggs stand for 6 minutes. Uncover and drain
          the eggs, then transfer to the bowl of ice wter and let stand for 3
          minutes. Drain and peel the eggs, then quarter each egg lengthwise.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Toss the American chees and Cheddar cheese together in a small bowl
          until evenly combined.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Roll the dough into a 20-by-14-inch rectangle on a lightly flavored
          work surface. Starting from the shorter end, spread the cheese mixture
          evenly over half of the dough, leaving 1-inch border on the sides.
          Scatter the sausage, bacon and potato tots evenly over the cheese.
          Arrange all the egg quarters, yolk up, along the short side of the
          rectangle. Working from the short side, tightly roll the dough up,
          jelly roll-style, into a log. Pinch the open seams together to seal,
          then tuck them underneath the log.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Beat the remaining egg. Transfer the log to the prepared baking sheet
          and brush with the egg wash. Bake until the bread is golden brown all
          over, about 40 minutes.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Let the bread cool for 10 minutes. Halve the bread lengthwise, cut
          each half crosswise into 4 equal pieces and serve warm with ketchup or
          hot sauce.
